This is a proof of concept of how 'AI zero-knowledge proofs' could be implemented.

Examples of use cases for AI zero-knowledge proofs:
1. Gather data and 
2. Enable researchers to verify hypotheses based on medical data without accessing personal health information directly
3. Insure the software on your device is benevolent.
4. Insure a person in trust is not being bribed.
5. Insure software operates within your personalized user consents.
6. Verify the authenticity and ethical sourcing of products without disclosing proprietary or sensitive information about suppliers
7. Financial institutions can prove they are adhering to regulations and not facilitating money laundering

All of this without risking breach of privacy or intellectual property.

How it works in short:
1. We have a black box (secured by whatever means technology allows us).
2. Bob uploads sensitive data by is send into the black box tied to clearly defined data contracts.
3. AI agents act within the black box bounded by its rules.
4. Third party asks the AI agents whether 

Open questions:
There are many, this is not a working product in any way, but I will list some major ones.
1. How to verify the computer running Transpairent or similar software is not breached or being used maliciously?
1.a For example do we need some type of homomorphic encryption?
2. How to verify the uploaded sensitive data is all encompassing to the relevant contract and not tampered with?
2.a I imagine C2PA and similar ideas would be required here.
